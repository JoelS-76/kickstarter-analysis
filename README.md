Analysis of various data from kickstarter to find trends
The Client ("Louise") plans a Crowdfunding campaign to raise $10,000 to fund her play production. I am analyzing data to see if there are any trends that distiguish successful campaigns from failed campaigns, to give Louise a better chance to succeed.

Since Louise is producing a play, I narrowed the field to look at all theater campaigns, and also all play productions within that category (As opposed to funding for spaces and for musicals). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84299125/121837021-e1781680-cc91-11eb-94c8-d5a10e2dada1.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84299125/121837086-0bc9d400-cc92-11eb-8287-a25215bb3d29.png). 

My own challenges in performing this analysis were mainly limited to the newness of the material and my lack of familiarity with the excel formulas. Also, there was so much data it was tempting to run various analyses on far more information than would truly be helpful, simply out of personal curiosity.

There were two main analyses: the outcomes of theater projects according to launch date, and the correlation between project outcomes and their financial goals.
The analysis of theater projects by date revealed that May had the highest number of successful projects, although anytime between April and August was above average. This was also the period of highest general activity; i.e., there were more projects going live during that time. May also had the highest number of failed projects. However, the difference between successful and failed projects was more significant in May than any other month.
The research of Theater outcomes relative to goal amount revealed the highest success rate for projects under $5,000. The respective rates of success and failure cross just above $10,000. Rates for projects higher than that amount cross multiple times, revealing little or no correlation, presumably due to small sample size. Above $15,000 the number of total projects may be too small to draw any reliable conclusions.

This dataset cannot explain why more people supported one project than another, or why May had such a high success rate. Projects in May were slightly below average in both number of backers and average donation amount. October had the highest number of backers per successful outcome, and November averaged the highest donation amount. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84299125/121882798-39cd0980-ccce-11eb-8ed1-a98f12373044.png) Nevertheless, May was by far the most successful month.

STILL WORKING ON THIS...
