Analysis of various data from kickstarter to find trends
The Client ("Louise") plans a Crowdfunding campaign to raise $10,000 to fund her play production. I am analyzing data to see if there are any trends that distiguish successful campaigns from failed campaigns, to give Louise a better chance to succeed.

Since Louise is producing a play, I narrowed the field to look at all theater campaigns, and also all play productions within that category (As opposed to funding for spaces and for musicals). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84299125/121837021-e1781680-cc91-11eb-94c8-d5a10e2dada1.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84299125/121837086-0bc9d400-cc92-11eb-8287-a25215bb3d29.png). I also isolated the Successful and Failed campaigns in the US for plays.
